Update my SYNC module backend to work with the new Airtable structure. I have three tables now: "Contacts", "Transcripts", and "Meetings".
Current Problem: My AirtableService class is querying a "Meetings" table but I now have separate "Contacts" and "Transcripts" tables. The system throws 422 errors when filtering by "processing_status" field.
New Airtable Structure:

Contacts table: Name, Company, Email, Phone, Last Contacted, Relationship Type, Notes
Transcripts table: Title, Processing Status (pending/processing/complete/failed), Transcript Content, Meeting Date, Duration, Participants, Otter ID
Meetings table: Name, Contact (linked), Meeting Date, Status, Duration, Action Items

Required Updates:

Update AirtableService class in shared/services/airtable.ts:

Replace getMeetings() method to query "Contacts" table instead
Add getTranscripts() method to query "Transcripts" table with filter: {Processing Status} = 'complete'
Add getContactsRaw() method for debugging
Fix the 422 error by using correct field names


Update /api/sync/meetings endpoint in routes.ts:

Query both Contacts and Transcripts tables separately
Match calendar meetings against both contact names and transcript titles
Return proper indicator flags (green for contacts, blue for transcripts)
Handle the confidence scoring for both types of matches


Fix the matching algorithm:

Match meeting titles against contact names (for green circles)
Match meeting titles against transcript titles (for blue circles)
Keep the existing 75% confidence threshold
Ensure past meetings only get transcript matches


Add debug endpoints:

/api/debug/airtable-contacts - Show all contacts
/api/debug/airtable-transcripts - Show all transcripts with processing_status=complete
/api/sync/status - Show integration health



Expected Behavior After Fix:

Calendar meetings should match against contact names for green circles
Calendar meetings should match against transcript titles for blue circles
No more 422 errors when querying Airtable
SYNC page shows meetings with proper visual indicators

Key Code Requirements:

Use this.base('Contacts') and this.base('Transcripts') instead of this.base('Meetings')
Filter transcripts with: filterByFormula: "{Processing Status} = 'complete'"
Extract contact names from "Name" field, not meeting titles
Keep existing Levenshtein distance matching logic
Maintain the same endpoint response format for frontend compatibility

Please update the backend code to implement this new structure while keeping the existing matching intelligence and API response format.
