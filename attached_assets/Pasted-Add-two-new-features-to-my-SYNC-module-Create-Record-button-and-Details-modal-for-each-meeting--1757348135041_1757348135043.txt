Add two new features to my SYNC module: "Create Record" button and "Details" modal for each meeting.
Backend Implementation (routes.ts):
Add these two new endpoints:

POST /api/sync/create-contact - Creates Airtable contact from meeting data

Extract contact name from meeting title patterns like "Brooklyn | RTLC Session" → "Brooklyn"
Parse meeting titles for: "Name |", "Meet with Name", "Name -" patterns
Create contact with fields: Name, Email (from attendees), Last Contacted, Relationship Type, Notes
Auto-determine relationship type: "coaching" → Client, "partner" → Partner, "team" → Alumni, default → Prospect
Return success/error response with created contact ID


GET /api/sync/meeting-details/:meetingId - Get detailed meeting info for modal

Find meeting by ID from calendar data
Add calculated fields: duration, attendee count, meeting type classification
Return enhanced meeting object with all available details



Frontend Implementation:
Update the SYNC page meeting rows to include:

Details Button - Opens modal showing:

Complete meeting info (date, time, location, description)
All attendees with emails and roles
Visual status indicators (blue/green circles)
Suggested contact name extracted from title
Meeting type classification


Create Record Button - On click:

Calls /api/sync/create-contact endpoint
Shows "Creating..." state during API call
Displays success/error toast notifications
Refreshes meeting list after creation
Changes to "Contact Exists" if contact already created



Key Requirements:

Use React Dialog component for modal
Include proper error handling and loading states
Extract contact names intelligently from meeting titles
Auto-refresh SYNC page after record creation to show green circles
Button should be disabled if contact already exists

Expected Result:
After creating a contact record for "Brooklyn | RTLC Coaching Session", the matching algorithm should find the new contact and display a green circle on page refresh.
Current SYNC Module Status:

Calendar integration working (37 meetings)
Airtable API connected (Base ID: applfGMNIZ9CVoA1b)
Matching algorithm functional with 75% confidence threshold
Tables: Contacts, Meetings, Transcripts all exist in Airtable
