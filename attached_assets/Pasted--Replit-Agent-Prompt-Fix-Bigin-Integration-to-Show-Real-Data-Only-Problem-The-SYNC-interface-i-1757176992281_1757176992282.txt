# Replit Agent Prompt: Fix Bigin Integration to Show Real Data Only

## Problem
The SYNC interface is showing green circles for contacts that don't exist in the actual Bigin CRM. The system is using fallback/simulated data instead of real API results.

## Required Fix
Ensure the Bigin integration uses ONLY real API data and never shows fallback contact matches in the UI.

## Specific Changes Needed

### 1. Remove Fallback Contact Matching
In the `/api/meetings` route, modify the Bigin contact matching logic to:
- Never use fallback contact data for matching decisions
- Only show green circles when real contacts are found via API
- Show clear logging when real vs fallback data is being used

### 2. Correct Contact Matching Logic
Update the meeting-to-contact matching to:
```typescript
// For each meeting, only show hasBiginMatch = true if:
// 1. Real Bigin API was successfully called AND
// 2. Real contacts were found that match the meeting

// NEVER show green circles when using fallback data
if (usingContactFallback) {
  // When using fallback, set hasBiginMatch = false for ALL meetings
  meeting.hasBiginMatch = false;
  meeting.biginConfidence = 0;
} else {
  // Only when using real API data, perform actual matching
  const realMatch = realContacts.find(contact => {
    // Real matching logic here
  });
  meeting.hasBiginMatch = !!realMatch;
  meeting.biginConfidence = realMatch ? calculatedConfidence : 0;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Add clear console logging to show:
- "Using REAL Bigin contact data: X contacts found"
- "Using FALLBACK Bigin data: matches disabled in UI"
- Specific contact names found via real API
- Which meetings get real matches vs no matches

### 4. Expected Behavior After Fix
Based on the actual Bigin CRM shown (only Jimi Hendrix and Mark Murphy):
- "Leo/Mark - Launch Box Chat" should show GREEN circle (Mark Murphy exists)
- All other meetings should show NO green circles (contacts don't exist)
- Console should clearly log real contact search results

## Implementation Requirements

- Remove fallback contact matching from UI display
- Only show green circles for real API contact matches
- Maintain fallback for API failures but don't show matches
- Add specific logging for real vs fallback contact data
- Ensure accurate representation of actual CRM data

## Testing Validation
After fix:
- Only meetings with real CRM contact matches show green circles
- Console logs clearly indicate real vs fallback data usage
- UI accurately reflects actual Bigin CRM contents
- No false positive contact matches displayed

This fix ensures the SYNC interface accurately represents real CRM data instead of showing misleading fallback matches.
