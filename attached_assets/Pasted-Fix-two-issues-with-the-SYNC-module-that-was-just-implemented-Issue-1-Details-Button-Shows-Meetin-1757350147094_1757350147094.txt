Fix two issues with the SYNC module that was just implemented:
Issue 1: Details Button Shows "Meeting not found" Error
The /api/sync/meeting-details/:meetingId endpoint is failing to find meetings. Fix this by:

Debug the meeting ID format - Log what meetingId is being received vs what's available
Check the calendar service call - Ensure outlookService.getMeetings() is working correctly
Add better error handling - If meeting not found in calendar, return the basic meeting data as fallback
Fix the endpoint logic:

javascript// Instead of failing, use fallback data
const meeting = calendarMeetings.find(m => m.id === meetingId) || 
                calendarMeetings.find(m => m.title.includes(meetingId)) ||
                { id: meetingId, title: "Meeting Details", error: "Limited data available" };
Issue 2: Contact Creation Only Saves First Name
The contact creation is working but only saving the name field. Fix the extractContactFromMeeting function to populate ALL required fields:

Add missing email extraction from attendees array
Add proper company field (default to "Unknown Company" if not available)
Add phone field (can be empty)
Ensure all Airtable required fields are populated
Use only the "Contacts" table - ignore "Contacts 2" table

Issue 3: Table Selection
Ensure contact creation only uses the main "Contacts" table, not "Contacts 2". Update the endpoint to:
javascriptawait airtableService.base('Contacts').create([{ fields: contactData }]);
Expected Contact Record Should Include:

Name: "Brooklyn"
Company: "Unknown Company" (if not determinable)
Email: (extracted from attendees if available)
Phone: "" (empty if not available)
Last Contacted: (meeting date)
Relationship Type: "Client" (for coaching sessions)
Contact Source: "Meeting Import"
Notes: "Meeting: Brooklyn | RTLC Coaching Session\nLast Contact: [date]"
Contact Status: "Active"

Testing Requirements:

Details button should open modal without errors
Contact creation should populate all visible fields in Airtable
Only use the main "Contacts" table
Green circle should still appear after contact creation

Current Status:

Contact matching IS working (green circle appeared)
Calendar integration working (37 meetings loaded)
Airtable API connected
Need to fix endpoint data handling and field population
