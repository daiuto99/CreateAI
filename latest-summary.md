# Diagnostic Report for calendar: error ical.parseICS is not a function

## 1) Top Problems with Likely Root Causes
- **Problem 1:** `ical.parseICS` is called but does not exist.
  - Root cause: The `ical` library version used does not support `parseICS`, or there is a typo in the method name.
- **Problem 2:** Incorrect import or outdated `ical` library usage.
  - Root cause: The code expects a method `parseICS` that may be named differently or is deprecated.
- **Problem 3:** Missing or incorrect installation of the `ical` library, causing runtime errors.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Check the installed `ical` package version in `package.json`.
- Replace the method call to the correct method provided by the `ical` library.
- Typical correct usage (in source file related to calendar processing, e.g., `calendar.js`):

```javascript
// Old incorrect call
// const events = ical.parseICS(data);

// Minimal fix: Replace with correct method (commonly, ical.parse is used)
const events = ical.parse(data);
```

- If unsure, change:

```javascript
ical.parseICS(...)
```

to

```javascript
ical.parse(...)
```

- Confirm the import statement matches the library's documentation:

```javascript
const ical = require('ical');
```

## 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- No environment variables or secrets indicated as missing in the logs.
- Verify if any calendar API keys or URLs are needed for fetching ICS data (check config files).
