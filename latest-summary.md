# Diagnostic Report for /api/auth/user 404 Error

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **Problem:** `GET /api/auth/user` returns 404 "API route not found".  
  **Root Cause:** The route handler for `/api/auth/user` is missing or not registered in the Express app.
- **Problem:** Route path typo or mismatch between client and server routes.
- **Problem:** Middleware or router not mounted properly for `/api/auth`.
- **Problem:** Server restart missing recent route additions.
- **Problem:** Route file not imported or included in main app file.

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **File:** Likely `server.js` or main Express app file.  
  **Fix:** Add or verify the following route:

```js
// Example minimal route handler
app.get('/api/auth/user', (req, res) => {
  // Dummy response to confirm route works
  res.json({ ok: true, user: null });
});
```

- If routes are modularized, ensure the router is imported and mounted, e.g.:

```js
const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth'); // correct path
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
```

- Verify that `routes/auth.js` exports a router with `/user` GET route.

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- No logs indicate env vars or secrets missing for this specific error.
- Confirm AUTH-related env vars (e.g., JWT_SECRET) are set but unrelated to 404.
