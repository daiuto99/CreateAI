# Surgical Log Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No error details despite `[ERROR ×1]` tag**: The single ERROR log line shows no message, indicating either missing error details or logging misconfiguration.
- **Health endpoint registered but no health check results shown**: Might be missing active health checks or readiness checks in the service.
- **Potential missing POST endpoint handlers or failures**: POST routes listed, but no confirmation of successful handler registration or handling logic.
- **Server startup logs only—no runtime or error traces**: Possible silent failures during runtime or unreported errors.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Fix missing ERROR message logging**  
  *File:* (unknown, likely logging middleware or error handler)  
  *Code snippet:*  
  ```js
  // Ensure error handler captures and logs error details
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error('Error:', err.message || err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  });
  ```
- **Add active health check logic**  
  *File:* (unknown, probably where /healthz endpoint is registered)  
  *Code snippet:*  
  ```js
  app.get('/healthz', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
  });
  ```
- **Verify POST endpoint handlers are implemented and error-handled**  
  *File:* unknown, for example `/api/meetings/dismiss` handler file  
  - Add console logs inside handlers to confirm invocation and check for silent failures.

### 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- No explicit missing env vars in logs, but verify:  
  - PORT (expected 5000 based on log)  
  - API keys / tokens for `/api/integrations` and external services like Otter or Airtable  
  - Database connection strings for meeting data  
  - Logging level or environment flag for error verbosity

### 4) Suggested Replit AI Prompts
- "How do I log detailed error messages in Express middleware for debugging?"
- "What is the minimal code to implement a health check endpoint in Express?"
- "How do I verify that all Express route handlers are registered and working?"
- "What env vars are commonly needed for integrating Airtable and Otter APIs?"
- "How to add express middleware that catches and logs runtime errors without stopping the server?"
- "How can I confirm my Node.js/Express server is receiving and handling POST requests?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
- Revert to the last known stable deployment version before these logs appeared to ensure all error logging and routes function correctly while fixes are applied.
- Test health endpoint and critical POST routes in isolation before re-deploying changes.
