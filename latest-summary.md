```markdown
### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No actual error messages present in the logs; only a normal server start message.
- The log shows the server booting but no confirmation of a successful listening event.
- Missing detailed error logs if the server failed to start; likely logging configuration issue.
- Possible missing or misconfigured environment variables since only NODE_ENV and PORT are shown.
- The server might not be binding to the correct interface or port, but no indication here.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add explicit error and success logging in the server start code:
  ```js
  // likely in server.js or app.js (unknown file)
  app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Server failed to start', err);
      process.exit(1);
    } else {
      console.log(`Server running on port ${process.env.PORT || 3000}`);
    }
  });
  ```
- Enhance logging configuration to capture startup errors fully.

### 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- Potentially missing:
  - DATABASE_URL or equivalent DB connection string
  - APP_SECRET or JWT_SECRET for authentication
  - LOG_LEVEL or similar for controlling verbosity
- Verify all required variables are set beyond NODE_ENV and PORT.

### 4) AI Prompts for Replit
- "Why does my Express server log only a boot message but not confirm it's listening?"
- "How to add error handling when starting an Express app listening on a port?"
- "What essential environment variables should be set for a Node.js backend?"
- "How to improve logging in Node.js for startup and runtime errors?"
- "How to verify and debug a Node.js app that starts but doesn't respond on a port?"
- "What are minimal startup logs I should have in Express server code?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
If recent changes introduced logging or environment config, revert to last known good commit to restore visible errors and confirm server listens successfully before reapplying changes incrementally.
