# Surgical Log Report

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
- **No severe errors found in logs:** Only an ERROR tag appears once, but no error message or stack trace is provided; it may be a misleading log tag or incomplete logging.
- **Possibly incomplete error reporting:** The error count (×1) is shown but no error details are visible—root cause could be improper error handling or suppressed logs.
- **Potential missing routes or middleware issues:** The logs only list routes; no confirmation of their successful handling or middleware loading, possibly causing runtime issues not captured here.
- **Environmental/configuration problems:** No environment variable or secret loading logs, so potential missing config could cause subtle bugs.
- **Port binding without confirmation of database or service connections:** The service listens on port 5000 but no confirmation of external dependencies (DB, APIs), so failures could occur downstream.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Add detailed error logging where errors occur** (unknown file, probably `server.js` or main Express app file):  
  ```js
  // Wrap route handlers and server startup with try/catch for better logs
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error('Express error:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  });
  ```
- **Verify route handlers are properly handling errors** (check all route files under `/routes` or wherever APIs are declared).
- **Ensure server startup logs confirm dependencies:**
  ```js
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
  if (!process.env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING) {
    console.warn('Warning: DB_CONNECTION_STRING env var is missing.');
  }
  ```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- `PORT` (default 5000 used, confirm if overridden)
- Database connection string (e.g., `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`)
- API keys or secrets for integrations (e.g., Otter.ai, Airtable)  
- Any auth tokens or credentials for `/api/integrations` endpoints  
Logs lack info on these typical envs, likely cause of silent failures.

2. "How to verify and log missing environment variables on Node.js startup?"
3. "What minimal code to log detailed errors in Express route handlers?"
4. "How to check if an Express.js server has successfully connected to a database before listening on a port?"
5. "Best practices to store and load secrets securely in Replit environment variables?"
6. "How to debug missing or silent error logs in a Node.js / Express app?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
If errors persist or unknown failures appear, rollback to last known good commit before recent changes to restore stable routing and environment configurations, then incrementally reapply fixes with thorough logging.
