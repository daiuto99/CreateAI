# Incident Report: /api/integrations/test 400 Error

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **400 Bad Request on POST /api/integrations/test**: Error message indicates "Missing WordPress..." suggesting required WordPress credentials or data are not provided.
- **Empty GET /api/integrations responses**: Multiple GET requests return empty arrays, implying no saved integrations found or data retrieval failure.
- **Success on POST /api/integrations but failure on /test**: Integration save works, but test endpoint fails, indicating validation or missing config during test.
- **Potential missing/incorrect environment variables or config for WordPress provider** needed for the /test endpoint.

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **File: `api/integrations/test.js`** (or relevant route handler file)
  - Add validation to check presence of WordPress credentials (e.g., URL, API key).
  - Example minimal fix:
    ```js
    if (!req.body.wordpressUrl || !req.body.wordpressApiKey) {
      return res.status(400).json({ ok: false, error: "Missing WordPress credentials" });
    }
    ```
- **File: integration saving logic** (e.g., `api/integrations/index.js`)
  - Ensure saved integration data includes all necessary WordPress config to be used in test.
- **Unknown file**: Code that reads env vars for WordPress credentials; make sure it's reading process.env.WORDPRESS_URL etc.

## 3) Missing env vars / secrets / config
- `WORDPRESS_URL` (WordPress site URL)
- `WORDPRESS_API_KEY` or equivalent API token for WordPress integration
- Any config related to authentication/authorization for WordPress API

## 4) Suggested AI Prompts for Replit
- "Explain why a 400 error is returned when missing required POST data in an Express API."
- "Show how to validate presence of WordPress credentials in a Node.js Express route."
- "Explain environment variable usage to secure WordPress API credentials in Node apps."
- "How to debug empty GET API responses returning [] when data is expected?"
- "Suggest code to test WordPress integration API programmatically in Node.js."
- "How to roll back last integration deployment safely in Express-based app?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
Revert the last deployment commit that introduced the /api/integrations/test endpoint or related changes, restoring the service to the previously working state where saving integrations did not cause test failures. This ensures the API returns success while root cause is investigated.
