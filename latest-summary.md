### 1) Top 3–5 problems with likely root causes
- No explicit errors or failures logged other than generic startup info; potential silent startup issue.
- Possible missing health check response implementation or improper status code (not visible in logs).
- No indication of middleware or error handlers for the endpoints - could lead to unhandled exceptions at runtime.
- Unclear if required environment variables (e.g., PORT, API keys) are set, risking runtime failures.
- Lack of detailed logging for routes could hinder debugging of API failures during requests.

### 2) Exact, minimal fixes
- **Unknown file,** add or verify health endpoint handler returns HTTP 200, e.g. in `server.js` or `routes/health.js`:
  ```js
  app.get('/healthz', (req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));
  ```
- Add basic error handling middleware (unknown file), typically at end of middleware stack:
  ```js
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  });
  ```
- Ensure app listens on environment variable `PORT` fallback, e.g., in main server file:
  ```js
  const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
  app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Serving on port ${port}`));
  ```

### 3) Missing env vars/secrets/config
- `PORT` environment variable (default 5000 is in use, but confirm).
- API keys or tokens for integrations (`/api/integrations`, `/api/otter/transcripts`, `/api/airtable/contacts`).
- Authentication secrets or session keys for secure endpoints (e.g., `/admin/latest-log-summary`).

- "Check Node.js Express app startup logs for missing environment variables causing silent crashes."
- "Suggest minimal Express.js error handling middleware and where to add it."
- "Explain how to implement a basic healthy status HTTP /healthz endpoint in Express."
- "How to configure port listening fallback for missing PORT env var in Express server."
- "Identify common reasons behind Express routes not responding despite server listening."
- "Verify environment variable usage pattern for third-party API keys in Node.js."

### 5) Rollback plan
If recent changes introduced instability, revert to the last known working commit or branch where all routes and health endpoint respond correctly, ensuring environment variables are properly configured and error handling is in place before redeploying.
