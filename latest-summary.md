# Surgical Report

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No explicit error messages or failures detected:** Logs only show server booting info without errors.
- **Potential missing clarity on environment setup:** Only `NODE_ENV` and `PORT` are mentioned; other required env vars might be absent.
- **Uncertainty if server is reachable or serving requests:** No logs on incoming requests or errors during runtime.
- **Possible missing script configuration:** Running `tsx server/index.ts` is shown, but no confirmation of build steps or dependencies.
- **Lack of logging detail:** Minimal logs; insufficient for debugging.

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **Add detailed logging to `server/index.ts`** to capture server start confirmation and request handling (line 10–20, approximate).
```typescript
console.log(`Express server started on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```
- **Check that `PORT` is properly read from environment in `server/index.ts`** (around server `.listen` call):
```typescript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`));
```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- Possibly missing:
  - `PORT` (though shown, confirm it's set properly)
  - Any database connection string (`DB_CONN` etc.)
  - API keys or tokens if used
  - Logging level or debug flags (e.g., `DEBUG=true`)
- Validate `.env` or environment injection consistency.

## 4) Plain-English AI Prompts for Replit
1. "How do I add detailed logging to an Express server in `server/index.ts` to debug startup and requests?"
2. "Why might my Node Express app only log server boot messages but no requests?"
3. "How to ensure environment variables like `PORT` and `NODE_ENV` are correctly loaded and used in a TypeScript Express server?"
4. "What minimal environment variables are required to run a simple Express app on Replit?"
5. "How can I improve error handling and logging for Express apps started with `tsx`?"
6. "What are common reasons an Express server doesn't respond despite showing startup logs?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to the last known working commit that includes explicit startup and request logging plus verified environment configuration to restore observability and functionality quickly.
