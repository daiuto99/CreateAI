# Diagnostic Report

## 1) Top Problems with Likely Root Causes
- **Empty response array on GET /api/integrations:** The endpoint returns `[]` despite a successful save, indicating either the fetch query is incorrect or the integration data is not persisted/read properly.
- **No error logs despite empty data:** The system logs success on saving but returns no integrations, suggesting a disconnect between saving and reading logic or caching issues.
- **Potential user context mismatch:** The save log references `user=dev-user`, but the GET request may not filter or fetch integrations for that user correctly.

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **Unknown file:** Likely in integration controller or model.
- Add or fix fetch logic to return saved integrations, filtered by `user=dev-user`.

Example fix (pseudo-code, assuming Node.js/Express and a database call):
```js
// integrationsController.js - line approx. 45
app.get('/api/integrations', async (req, res) => {
  const user = req.user?.username || 'dev-user'; // Make sure user context is correct
  const integrations = await Integration.find({ user: user }); // Filter by user
  res.json(integrations);
});
```

## 3) Missing env vars/secrets/config
- Potential missing or incorrect user ID middleware or session configuration to identify `dev-user`.
- DB connection string or read permissions seem OK (since save succeeds), no direct evidence of missing env vars here.

## 4) Plain-English AI Prompts for Replit
1. "Help me debug why my GET /api/integrations endpoint returns an empty array despite a successful save for user=dev-user."
2. "Show me example Express code that fetches and returns stored integrations for a logged-in user."
3. "What minimal code changes are needed to fix an empty response problem after successfully saving data in MongoDB?"
4. "How to ensure API fetch requests filter database results correctly by the current user?"
5. "Identify common causes for successful DB save logs but empty reads in Node.js applications."
6. "How to debug session or user context issues when API responses return empty results?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
Revert the latest code or configuration changes that modified the integration save or fetch logic to the last known working state. This ensures integration data can be correctly retrieved while isolating new bugs.
