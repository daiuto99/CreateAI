## Surgical Report

### 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
- **No errors or warnings reported:** Logs show no explicit errors or failures; only info and a single error tag that is misleading since it shows normal startup messages.
- **Possible mislabeling of log level:** `[ERROR ×1]` is logged with normal startup info, indicating possible incorrect log level usage in the code.
- **Lack of detailed request handling issues:** No evidence that admin or API routes are tested or functioning beyond registration.
- **No visibility into environment or config issues:** Logs do not show missing environment variables or secrets; they may be silently failing if misconfigured.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Fix log severity labeling:**  
  - File: `logger.js` or wherever logging is configured (unknown file)  
  - Change lines logging startup info from `error()` to `info()` or `debug()`:
    ```js
    // Before
    logger.error(`express serving on port ${PORT}`);
    
    // After
    logger.info(`express serving on port ${PORT}`);
    ```
- **Add startup verification endpoint tests or logs** to confirm route functionality (unknown file).

### 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- No explicit mention or error regarding missing environment variables in logs.
- Verify environment variables expected by the server (e.g., `PORT`, API keys) are set in Replit or local environment.

### 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
1. "Check why my server logs an error message during normal startup even though the server starts successfully."
2. "Help me audit the log level usage in my Node.js/Express project to ensure errors are logged properly."
3. "Show me how to verify that all registered Express routes are working correctly after server start."
4. "What environment variables should I check to ensure my Express app fully initializes without silent failures?"
5. "Recommend how to add health endpoint automated tests in an Express.js app."
6. "Suggest minimal fixes to update logging levels in a Node.js server app."

### 5) Rollback Plan
If recent changes introduced improper log levels or route registration issues, rollback to the last stable commit before these changes to restore correct logging behavior and route availability.
