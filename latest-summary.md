# Diagnostic Report

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No errors found in logs:** All entries are normal info/debug level logs without error messages.
- **Potential problem: Health endpoint only informational** — No indication if other endpoints are actively serving or returning errors.
- **No confirmation of successful route handlers beyond registration** — Could mean routes exist but are non-functional.
- **No indication of configuration or startup failures** — Server started correctly on port 5000 with expected routes.

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **Unknown** given logs show no errors or issues. Recommend adding error logging middleware for express to capture runtime failures.
- Example addition (in server setup file, e.g. `app.js`):
  ```js
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error('Express error:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  });
  ```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- Environment variable `PORT` is not confirmed but server is fixed to `5000` (hardcoded).
- Confirm if config supports dynamic port assignment.
- No API keys or auth tokens visible but may be needed for secure admin routes or API calls.

## 4) Suggested Plain-English AI Prompts for Replit
- "How to add centralized error logging middleware in an Express.js app?"
- "Best practices for environment variable usage in Node.js server apps?"
- "How to confirm API route handlers are functioning correctly in Express?"
- "What Express middleware can help in debugging production errors?"
- "How to securely manage admin-only route access in Express.js?"
- "How to implement health check endpoints properly in Node.js with Express?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
- Revert to previously deployed commit known to have stable logs and verified route functionality.
- Restart server and confirm logs show expected output with no error messages, ensuring health and admin endpoints respond as expected.
