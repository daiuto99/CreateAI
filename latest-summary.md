# Diagnostic Report

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No actual errors found**; only informational logs indicating the server started successfully.
- Routes registered correctly, no sign of missing endpoints.
- No indication that any environment variables or secrets failed to load.
- Server listens on port 5000 without bind issues.
- Possible silent failure or missing logs if unexpected behavior occurs (no error logs in snippet).

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- No explicit errors or misbehaviors shown needing code change.
- Verify the health endpoint `/healthz` returns expected response.
- Suggest implementing or enhancing error logging (middleware) for better diagnostics (in `unknown file`, likely `app.js` or `server.js`):

```javascript
// Add after route definitions, before app.listen
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});
```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- None indicated in logs.
- Confirm `.env` or config file includes:
  - `PORT=5000` or alternative if configurable.
  - API keys for external integrations (Otter, Airtable, calendar service).
  - Database connection strings or credentials if applicable.

## 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
1. "How do I add global error handling middleware in Express?"
2. "Show me how to check if an Express route `/healthz` is working correctly."
3. "What environment variables are typically needed for a Node.js app with APIs for Airtable and Otter?"
4. "Provide best practices for logging errors and start-up info in Express apps."
5. "How to confirm the port binding was successful in an Express.js app?"
6. "What can cause an Express server to start with no errors but fail silently?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
If issues continue, roll back to the last known good deployment by restoring the previous version of the code and environment, then incrementally reapply recent changes with enhanced logging to pinpoint failures.
