### Surgical Report

#### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No explicit errors or failures in the logs, only informational messages.
- No application routes missing or failing to register.
- Serving port 5000 correctly initialized with expected endpoints.
- **Inference**: App is starting normally but lacks error/warning logs indicating deeper problems.
- Possible silent failures outside these logs or missing monitoring of critical app states.

#### 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- Unknown file; logs suggest Express app startup is fine.
- Suggest add comprehensive error logging middleware in Express to catch runtime errors.
```javascript
// Add to main Express app file (e.g., app.js or index.js) after all routes:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});
```
- Optionally add logging at route handlers to confirm execution.

#### 3) Missing env vars/secrets/config
- Logs do not reveal any env/config issues.
- Confirm environment variables for port (default 5000 set) and any API keys needed by /api/calendar/events.
- No secret loading errors visible.

#### 4) Suggested Replit AI Prompts
1. "How do I add global error handling middleware to an Express app in Node.js?"
2. "Best practices for logging unhandled errors in Express.js"
3. "How to verify API route handlers are executed in Express logs"
4. "How to set and verify environment variables for a Node.js app on Replit"
5. "Common causes for silent failures in Express applications"
6. "How to enable detailed debug logging in an Express server"

#### 5) Rollback Plan
- Revert to previous stable commit or deployment if available.
- Ensure recent changes did not disable error logging or crucial route registration.
