## Surgical Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No actual errors reported** despite an "[ERROR]" tag at the top — likely a misleading log level rather than a runtime failure.
- **No health or other endpoints failing to register**; all routes are listed, so routing initialization seems fine.
- **Possible silent failure or incomplete information** as no runtime errors, crashes, or failed route registrations appear.
- **Potential mislabeling of log severity levels** causing confusion (ERROR level without an error message).
- **Missing detailed startup logs or dependency warnings**, which could hide configuration or connection issues (e.g., DB, API keys).

### 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **Fix log severity labeling** to avoid misclassification:
  - Likely in the logging setup file (e.g. `logger.js` or `server.js`).
  - Change:
    ```js
    logger.error("serving on port 5000");
    ```
    To:
    ```js
    logger.info("serving on port 5000");
    ```
  
- **Add explicit error handling and logging** in startup to capture any hidden issues:
  ```js
  app.listen(PORT, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      logger.error("Server failed to start:", err);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    logger.info(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
  });
  ```
  (Likely in `server.js`, around line where `app.listen()` is called)

### 3) Missing env vars/secrets/config
- Not directly visible from logs, but typical critical env vars might be:
  - `PORT=5000` (ensure set or default value in config)
  - API keys for integrations (e.g., OTTER_API_KEY, AIRTABLE_API_KEY)
  - Firebase service credentials (for `/api/auth/firebase-bridge`)
  - Database connection string or credentials for meetings storage
- Recommend checking config loading and `.env` file completeness.

### 4) Suggested AI Prompts for Replit
1. "Explain how to configure logging levels properly in a Node.js Express app to avoid misleading error messages."
2. "Show me minimal Express server code with robust error handling on `app.listen()`."
3. "How to verify all required environment variables are set at app startup in Node.js?"
4. "How to implement health endpoint (`GET /healthz`) in Express with status code 200 and JSON response?"
5. "What common mistakes cause an Express server to log 'error' without actual failure?"
6. "How to securely store and use API keys and secrets in a Node.js backend?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
If issues persist after fixes, revert to the previously deployed stable version by restoring the last known good commit or deployment snapshot, ensuring you have working logs and environment configurations before restarting.
