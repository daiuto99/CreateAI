# Surgical Report

### 1) Top 3–5 Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No critical errors reported beyond startup logs**: The logs show normal startup and endpoint registration with no explicit errors.
- **Unclear if all endpoints function correctly**: Presence only of route registration messages without test requests or error logs means runtime issues might be hidden.
- **Potential missing environment variables or secrets**: No direct log evidence, but common cause when services fail silently or routes misbehave.
- **Unconfirmed database or external API connections**: Logs lack info on integrations being live or failing.
- **Lack of logging on POST endpoints execution**: Only route listing shown, no success/failure logs for mutations, which could hide issues.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add detailed logging middleware to capture request success/failure:
  - **File:** `unknown` (likely server or middleware file e.g. `app.js` or `index.js`)
  - **Code:**
    ```js
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.on('finish', () => {
        console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} ${res.statusCode}`);
      });
      next();
    });
    ```
- Verify environment variable usage with a startup check (in `app.js` or config loader):
  ```js
  if (!process.env.DB_URI) {
    console.error("Missing environment variable: DB_URI");
    process.exit(1);
  }
  ```
- Add error handling logs in route handlers, e.g., for `/api/integrations` POST.

### 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- Possible missing or unvalidated:
  - `DB_URI`
  - `API_KEYS` for integrations (e.g. Otter, Airtable, Firebase)
  - `PORT` (fallback to 5000 present but not confirmed)
- Firebase bridge likely needs `FIREBASE_CONFIG` or service account key.

### 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
1. _"How do I add middleware to Express.js to log every HTTP request with method, URL, and status code?"_
2. _"How can I check for required environment variables at Node.js application startup and exit if missing?"_
3. _"Show me example error handling and logging for POST Express routes."_
4. _"What environment variables are typically needed for Airtable, Firebase, and Otter integrations in a Node.js backend?"_
5. _"How to add a health check endpoint in Express that returns 200 OK status?"_
6. _"Ways to debug missing or silent failures in an Express REST API"_

### 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to the last stable deployment or commit prior to recent changes — ensuring the server starts cleanly with all routes functional and known environment variables set — to regain baseline working status.
