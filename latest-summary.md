# Surgical Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No explicit errors in logs; the server starts normally.
- Potential missing or incomplete route handlers (e.g., no confirmation that `/admin/latest-log-summary` or `/api/calendar/events` endpoints respond correctly).
- No logs on actual requests or errors after startup, indicating missing logging or monitoring.
- Possible missing environment configuration for running on port 5000 or connecting to required services.
- No signs of secrets or API keys being loaded or validated.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add explicit success/error logging inside each route handler (e.g., in `/api/calendar/events` route) to confirm functionality.
  
  **Likely in** `server.js` or `app.js` near routes definitions:

  ```js
  app.get('/api/calendar/events', (req, res) => {
    // Add logging
    console.log("GET /api/calendar/events called");
    // Existing event fetching logic...
    res.json(events);
  });
  ```

- Verify port setting uses an environment variable fallback:

  ```js
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Serving on port ${PORT}`));
  ```

### 3) Missing env vars / secrets / config
- `PORT` (if intended for flexible deployment)
- API keys or tokens for calendar event fetching (e.g., `CALENDAR_API_KEY` or similar)
- Possibly admin credentials or secrets for `/admin/latest-log-summary` route
- Logging level or monitoring config

### 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
- "How to add detailed request and error logging to Express route handlers?"
- "Show example of secure environment variable usage for API keys in Node.js."
- "Suggest minimal Express.js health check and admin endpoint with authentication."
- "How to best roll back a Node.js server deployment if route handlers break?"
- "Explain monitoring setup to capture API request errors in an Express app."
- "What env variables are commonly required for calendar API integration in Node.js?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
- Revert codebase to last confirmed stable commit that successfully served API routes and returned expected responses.
- Restart server and verify endpoints respond as expected before new changes.
