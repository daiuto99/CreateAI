```markdown
### 1) Top Problems & Root Causes
- No explicit error messages beyond startup logs. The "ERROR ×1" notation is ambiguous and possibly a logging artifact, not a runtime failure.
- The server boots with `NODE_ENV=development` and `PORT=5000`, but no confirmation that the server actually started listening on `PORT`.
- Lack of environment variables or configuration validation in logs suggests missing checks for required env vars.
- The `tsx` command hints use of TypeScript execution, which might fail silently if dependencies or TS config are misaligned.
- The startup command sets env vars inline, which might not work cross-platform (e.g., Windows cmd).

### 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- Ensure server listens and logs success explicitly after boot:
  ```ts
  // server/index.ts lines ~20-30 (where server.listen is called)
  server.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${process.env.PORT || 5000}`);
  });
  ```
- Add environment validation early in `server/index.ts`:
  ```ts
  if (!process.env.PORT) {
    console.error("Error: PORT env var not set");
    process.exit(1);
  }
  ```
- For cross-platform env setting, update `package.json` script or use `cross-env`:
  ```json
  "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
  ```

### 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- `PORT` is set inline but not confirmed in env; should be in `.env` or config management.
- Possible missing `.env` file or `.env` contents with key/value pairs (e.g., `PORT=5000`).
- No sign of secrets/config for DB or API keys.

### 4) AI Prompts for Replit
- "How can I validate required environment variables early in a Node.js Express app?"
- "Show me how to log server startup confirmation after calling server.listen in Express."
- "How do I make npm scripts cross-platform compatible with environment variables?"
- "What is the purpose of the tsx command, and how do I troubleshoot silent failures?"
- "Provide a minimal Express server startup code sample including env validation and listen confirmation."
- "How to handle missing .env files and fallback safely in Node.js apps?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to the last known working commit if the current server fails to start or crashes after deployment. Confirm environment variables and dependencies are properly configured before redeploying.
