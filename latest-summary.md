# Surgical Report

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
- **Problem:** Repeated or ambiguous routing for `POST /api/integrations` listed twice in logs  
  **Likely Cause:** Route duplication in express router setup causing conflicts or unexpected behavior.
- **Problem:** No explicit error messages though only one error noted is the console output that server started, no critical failures seen  
  **Likely Cause:** Possible missing or incomplete error logging elsewhere; logs incomplete.
- **Problem:** Lack of health check failures suggests server is up but does not guarantee downstream service connectivity or authentication setup.
- **Problem:** Routes reference external services/integrations (e.g. Otter, Airtable), possibility of missing or misconfigured environment variables for API keys or secrets.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Fix duplicated route** in router setup file (likely something like `routes/integrations.js` or main `app.js`):  
  ```js
  // Find code where POST /api/integrations is defined twice; remove the redundant one
  // Example (unknown file):
  // Remove or comment out the duplicate line:
  router.post('/api/integrations', integrationsController.handler) // remove duplicate
  ```
- **Add enhanced error logging** if missing, at server startup and route handlers:  
  ```js
  // In main server file (e.g., app.js, line ~30)
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  });
  ```

## 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- API keys / tokens for external integrations, such as:
  - OTTER_API_KEY
  - AIRTABLE_API_KEY
  - CALENDAR_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS or TOKEN
- PORT defined as 5000 explicitly? Ensure defaults and overrides set.
- Possibly `NODE_ENV` for environment-specific behavior.

## 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit’s AI
1. "Check this Express server code for duplicate route registrations and suggest minimal fixes."
2. "Suggest best practices to log errors globally in an Express.js app."
3. "What environment variables do I need to run integrations with Otter.ai and Airtable in an Express app?"
4. "How can I ensure API keys are securely loaded in a Node.js environment?"
5. "Explain how to implement and test health check endpoints in Express."
6. "Recommend a rollback strategy if recent route changes cause server errors."

## 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to the last known stable commit before route additions or changes to `/api/integrations`, ensuring the server runs without duplicated routes. Redeploy and confirm health endpoint responds before reintroducing changes.
