# Surgical Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No errors or warnings beyond normal startup logs; server boots in development mode on port 5000.
- Lack of explicit confirmation that server started successfully—possible silent failure or missing success log.
- No logs about environment variable loading—potential missing `.env` or config file.
- Absence of any runtime errors may imply issues happen post-boot, not captured here.
- Potential missing or misconfigured environment variables needed for full operation beyond NODE_ENV and PORT.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add explicit success log in `server/index.ts` after server starts:
  ```ts
  // server/index.ts, after app.listen(...)
  console.log(`[express] ✅ Server started on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
  ```
- Add check for mandatory env vars at startup, example:
  ```ts
  // server/index.ts, near imports
  if (!process.env.PORT) {
    console.error("[express] ❌ PORT environment variable missing.");
    process.exit(1);
  }
  ```
- Ensure `.env` file or environment config exists with at least:
  ```
  NODE_ENV=development
  PORT=5000
  ```

### 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- Potential missing `.env` or environment config beyond the logs.
- No evidence of database URLs, API keys, or other secrets — verify presence if needed.

### 4) Replit AI Prompts
- "How to add startup success log in a Node.js Express app?"
- "What are minimal environment variables required to run an Express server locally?"
- "How to verify environment variable presence in a TypeScript Node.js app?"
- "How to handle missing required environment variables gracefully on server startup?"
- "What does the 'NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts' command do?"
- "How to configure environment variables in Replit for Node.js projects?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
If new logging or env checks cause startup failures, revert `server/index.ts` modifications to last stable commit, ensuring the app starts as before without added logs or checks.
