# Surgical Log Analysis Report

---

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
1. **404 on POST /api/auth/firebase-bridge**  
   Root cause: The API route `/api/auth/firebase-bridge` is missing or not registered in the Express app.

2. **Fast 0ms response on POST request**  
   Root cause: Early termination due to missing route, indicating no fallback or middleware catching this path.

3. **No error on GET /api/integrations (304 status)**  
   Root cause: Likely caching works correctly for this route; no action required here (control check).

---

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes

- Verify file where routes are defined (commonly `routes/auth.js` or `routes/api.js`)  
- Add/register missing route handler:

```js
// Example: in routes/api.js or routes/auth.js
app.post('/api/auth/firebase-bridge', (req, res) => {
  // minimal placeholder handler to avoid 404
  res.status(501).json({ok: false, error: 'Not implemented yet'});
});
```

- Confirm routes file is properly imported and used in main server file (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`):

```js
const apiRoutes = require('./routes/api');
app.use('/api', apiRoutes);
```

---

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config

- No explicit mention in logs, but verify Firebase config and env vars like:
  - `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
  - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
  - `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- Missing or incorrect Firebase config can cause auth bridge failure downstream even if route exists.

## 4) Suggested Plain-English AI Prompts for Replit

1. "How do I add a new POST route in Express for `/api/auth/firebase-bridge` that returns a JSON error placeholder?"
2. "Show me an Express route setup example that handles missing API endpoints with a 404."
3. "Explain how to structure Firebase environment variables for a Node.js backend."
4. "How can I verify routes are correctly registered and reachable in an Express app?"
5. "What does a 304 response mean in Express and should I worry about it when debugging an API?"
6. "Give me a minimal example of a Firebase authentication bridge endpoint for Node.js."

---

## 5) Rollback Plan

- Revert to the last known commit where `/api/auth/firebase-bridge` route was functional or present.
- Test Express route availability locally before redeploying.
