# Surgical Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **Duplicate POST /api/integrations routes**: Listed twice in logs, likely causing route conflicts or unexpected behavior.
- **No explicit error messages shown despite [ERROR ×1] tag**: Error cause is unclear; possibly startup or middleware registration issues.
- **No indication of DB or 3rd party integrations connection success**: Potential missing environment variables or secrets.
- **No CORS or security middleware logs**: May lead to request failures or vulnerabilities.
- **Default port 5000 used but no fallback**: Could cause conflicts if port is occupied.

### 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **Remove duplicate route registration in `server.js` (or equivalent file)**.  
  Example:
  ```js
  // Remove redundant line:
  app.post('/api/integrations', integrationsHandler);
  ```
  Keep only one POST `/api/integrations` registration.

- **Add error event listener for the Express app startup** to capture and log errors clearly (unknown file, typically `server.js`):
  ```js
  app.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Express server error:', err);
  });
  ```

- **Ensure environment variables are loaded and validated at start** (add at top of `server.js`):
  ```js
  if (!process.env.PORT) {
    console.warn('PORT env var not set; defaulting to 5000');
  }
  ```

### 3) Missing env vars/secrets/config
- `PORT` (if not set, defaults to 5000 but should be explicit)
- Possible secrets for integrations (Firebase, Airtable, Otter) not logged/verified
- DB connection string or API keys not confirmed

### 4) AI Prompts for Replit
1. "Find and resolve duplicate Express route registrations in a Node.js server from this snippet."
2. "Add error handling to an Express app to log startup errors."
3. "How to validate required environment variables in a Node.js app before starting the server?"
4. "Best practices for securely managing API keys and secrets in an Express backend."
5. "Explain what could cause an Express server to log an error at startup without stack trace."
6. "How to handle port conflicts gracefully in Express.js?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to the last stable deployment commit where server started cleanly without duplicate routes or errors, ensuring environment variables were properly loaded and integration endpoints tested.
