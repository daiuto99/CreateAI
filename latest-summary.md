# Diagnostic Report

### 1) Top 3–5 problems with likely root causes
- **Missing explicit ERROR details**: The logs show an `[ERROR ×1]` but no error message is displayed, indicating logging may be incomplete or misconfigured.
- **Health endpoint works but no evidence of API request success/failure**: Only health and route registrations are logged; no API call logs, suggesting endpoints might not be functioning or requests are not reaching.
- **Potential missing environment configuration**: No logs about database or external service connections hint at missing secrets or environment variables.
- **Insufficient log verbosity**: Logs show startup and route registrations only, lacking runtime errors or request logs needed for diagnosis.
- **Port binding successful but no follow-up logs**: The server starts on port 5000, but no further activity is visible, possibly due to firewall or network issues.

### 2) Exact, minimal fixes
- **Enable detailed error logging:**  
  *File:* Unknown (likely `server.js` or `app.js`)  
  *Fix:* Add or enhance error logging middleware, e.g.,

  ```js
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error('Unhandled Error:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  });
  ```

- **Add request logging middleware:**  
  *File:* Unknown  
  *Fix:*

  ```js
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
  });
  ```

- **Verify environment variables for API integrations** (see below).

### 3) Missing env vars/secrets/config
- API keys or tokens for:
  - Otter.ai API (`OTTER_API_KEY` ?)
  - Airtable (`AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`)
  - Calendar API credentials (e.g., `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY`)
- Server port configuration: If port is hardcoded 5000, consider `PORT` environment variable.
- Logging level (`LOG_LEVEL=debug` to increase verbosity).

### 4) Plain-English prompts for Replit’s AI
1. "How do I add Express middleware to log each request's method and URL?"
2. "Show me how to implement a global error handler in Express.js that logs errors to the console."
3. "List common environment variables needed for integrating Airtable, Otter.ai, and Google Calendar APIs."
4. "Explain how to confirm if an Express server is properly receiving API requests beyond startup logs."
5. "How to increase logging verbosity in an Express.js application?"
6. "Suggest minimal code changes to detect and log missing environment variables at startup."

### 5) Rollback plan
Restore the last stable commit or deployment that included working logs and confirmed API endpoint functionality. Verify server startup logs and API response success before proceeding with fixes.
