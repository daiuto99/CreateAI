# Engineering Diagnostic Report

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
- **No actual ERROR logged despite `[ERROR ×1]` tag in summary:** The logs show no error messages, indicating either the error was misclassified or logs are incomplete.
- **Potential missing route handlers:** While routes are registered, absence of confirmation about their successful functionality may indicate missing or faulty handler code.
- **No environment variable or secret usage shown:** The logs show server starting on port 5000, but port configuration may be hardcoded instead of using environment variables.
- **No explicit error/debug info about middleware or DB connections:** This implies missing error handling or logging around external dependencies.
- **Health endpoint works but no indication of other endpoints’ health/status:** The "healthz" endpoint is registered, but other endpoints lack health/status verification.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Unknown file (likely server setup, e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`)**
- Add or enhance error logging for routes:
  ```js
  // Example wrapping route handlers with error handling
  app.get('/admin/latest-log-summary', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
      // existing handler code
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error in /admin/latest-log-summary:', err);
      res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }
  });
  ```
- Adjust port configuration to use environment variable:
  ```js
  // At top of server file (e.g., server.js)
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`[express] serving on port ${PORT}`);
  });
  ```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- `PORT` environment variable to allow flexible port binding.
- Any database or external API credentials are not shown but likely missing—ensure `.env` or secrets configured.
- Config for logging verbosity or error reporting levels.

## 4) Plain-English AI Prompts for Replit
1. "How do I add centralized error handling middleware in an Express.js app?"
2. "How can I configure an Express.js server to use a port from environment variables?"
3. "What are best practices for logging errors and request info in Express routes?"
4. "Show example code to register and test a health endpoint in Express."
5. "How to verify all Express routes are properly registered and working?"
6. "What environment variables should I set for a Node.js/Express API project?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
If the new code causes issues, revert the changes and restart the server with the previous stable commit, keeping the port hardcoded to 5000 until environment variable support is validated.
