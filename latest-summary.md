## Surgical Log Analysis Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No explicit errors or failures in logs; only standard startup info visible.
- Potential silent failure if server is not reachable despite "serving on port 5000" message.
- Missing detailed error logs might indicate an unhandled runtime issue.
- Absence of environment configuration confirmation (e.g., DB connection success).
- Possible misconfiguration or missing dependencies causing silent fallback.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add explicit logging for startup and connectivity success/failure in `server/index.ts` around line ~20 (where Express `listen` is called):
```ts
app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log("[express] serving on port 5000");
  // Add health check here, e.g., DB connection ping
});
```
- Add try-catch around critical startup code to log errors explicitly.
- Verify all dependencies in `package.json` and ensure `tsx` is installed.

### 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- No confirmation of `DATABASE_URL` or other backend service URLs.
- Missing explicit `PORT` env var; hardcoding 5000 limits flexibility.
- Potentially required `API_KEYS`, `JWT_SECRET`, or config not loaded/sourced.

### 4) AI Prompts for Replit
- "Analyze why Express app logs 'serving on port 5000' but is not responsive or throwing no errors."
- "Generate code snippet to add detailed startup error logging in a TypeScript Express server."
- "List essential environment variables for a production-ready Node.js web server."
- "Suggest diagnostics steps for a Node.js Express app that starts silently without errors."
- "Explain how to test an Express server health programmatically on start."
- "Give minimal example to safely load and validate environment variables in Node.js."

### 5) Rollback Plan
- Revert to last known working commit with stable server start & connectivity confirmation.
- Restore any removed logging or health checks to identify hidden startup issues.
