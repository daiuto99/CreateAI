## Engineering Diagnostic Report

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **`ical.parseICS is not a function` error**  
  Likely cause: Using an outdated or incorrect version of the `ical` library, or the function `parseICS` does not exist/export from the installed package.
- **Multiple 404 GET / errors from Express**  
  Cause: The root route `/` is either not defined in the Express app or static files are not properly served.
- **Duplicate 404 logs for the same route**  
  Cause: Possible multiple middleware or routes handling root requests incorrectly.
- **General missing route handling**  
  No fallback route or static path is configured.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **For `ical.parseICS` issue:**  
  *File:* (likely wherever ical is imported, e.g., `calendar.js` or similar)  
  *Fix:* Replace `ical.parseICS` with the correct function from the current `ical` package.  
  Example:  
  ```js
  // Before
  const ical = require('ical');
  const data = ical.parseICS(icsString);
  
  // After (per 'ical' npm docs)
  const ical = require('ical');
  const data = ical.parseICS ? ical.parseICS(icsString) : ical.parseICSFromString(icsString); 
  // OR (most likely)
  const data = ical.parseICSFromString(icsString);
  
  // If parseICSFromString does not exist, use:
  const data = ical.parseICS(icsString);
  // Verify with installed ical version or use alternative like `node-ical.parseICS`
  ```
  Likely you need to verify the function name; the installed package might use `ical.parseICS` or `ical.parse` or `ical.parseICSFromString`.

- **For 404 root requests:**  
  *File:* `app.js` or the main Express server file  
  *Fix:* Add a route handler for `/` to serve content or redirect. Example:  
  ```js
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the home page');
  });
  ```
  Alternatively, serve static files:  
  ```js
  app.use(express.static('public'));
  ```
  
### 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- No direct reference from logs, but verify:  
  - Environment config for static file path or base URL is set.  
  - No secret/env missing related to calendar API (if used).

2. "How to set up a default route in Express to avoid 404 errors on GET / requests."  
3. "Show minimal Express middleware to serve static files from a public directory."

Revert to last known stable commit before changes to the calendar module and Express routing to restore correct function calls and route handling, minimizing downtime while applying fixes.
