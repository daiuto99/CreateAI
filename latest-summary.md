# Diagnostic Report

## 1) Top Issues & Likely Root Causes
- No explicit runtime errors seen; only one `[ERROR]` line and it appears as a log message rather than a failure.
- The `[ERROR ×1] 6:35:36 PM [express] serving on port 5000` likely is a mislabelled info message or a log formatting bug.
- No confirmed service startup or route registration failures.
- Missing health check failures or other warning-level logs suggest routes and server mostly okay.
- Potential silent failures due to missing environment variables or secrets (e.g. API keys, DB creds) not seen in logs but often critical.

## 2) Minimal Fixes
- Fix log label from `[ERROR]` to `[INFO]` or `[DEBUG]` in the express startup logging code.

  **File:** Possibly `server.js` or main Express app file  
  **Code snippet to fix around line where server listens (example):**
  ```js
  // Before
  console.error(`[ERROR] serving on port ${PORT}`)

  // After
  console.info(`[INFO] serving on port ${PORT}`)
  ```
- Confirm all routes are explicitly registered in the route setup file (no missing handlers).
- Add error handling middleware if not present, to capture silent failures.

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- No explicit denials/errors about missing env vars in logs, but commonly needed:
  - `PORT` (defaults to 5000 here, but should confirm)
  - `API_KEYS` for external integrations like Otter, Airtable
  - Firebase secrets for `/api/auth/firebase-bridge`
  - Database connection strings
- Review `.env` or deployment configs to verify presence.

## 4) Suggested AI Prompts for Replit
1. "Explain how to change console log level from error to info in a Node.js Express app."
2. "How do I add centralized error handling middleware in Express to catch all route errors?"
3. "What common environment variables are required for Express apps integrating with Firebase and Airtable?"
4. "How can I verify that my Express server has started successfully without errors?"
5. "Write Express.js code to register a health endpoint at GET /healthz."
6. "How to properly log server startup messages in Node.js so they aren't misclassified as errors?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
If issues persist after logging fixes, rollback to last stable commit/config that successfully started the server without error labels and with confirmed environment variables set correctly to ensure minimal disruption.
