```markdown
### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **No server startup confirmation or errors beyond boot message:** Likely server isn’t fully starting or crashing silently.
- **No `PORT` environment variable explicitly set in logs or `.env`:** Server may default or fail binding correctly.
- **No indication that TypeScript compilation/watch succeeded:** Possible missing or misconfigured TS config or `tsx` usage.
- **`NODE_ENV=development` is set, but no indication of debug/log verbosity:** Development mode might be ineffective without proper config.
- **No database or external service connection logs:** Potential missing config for downstream services if app depends on them.

### 2) Exact Minimal Fixes
- **File:** `server/index.ts`
- Add minimal startup confirmation log after server binds, e.g.:

```ts
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

- **File:** `.env` (if missing)
Add:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

- Ensure `package.json` script includes:

```json
"dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
```

### 3) Missing Environment Variables / Secrets / Config
- `PORT` (explicit definition recommended)
- Any DB_CONNECTION string or API keys if applicable (not evident but commonly needed)
- `NODE_ENV` is set but ensure it is exported globally or loaded via dotenv

### 4) Suggested Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
- "Help me add a confirmation log message when my Express server starts listening."
- "Show me how to ensure environment variables are loaded properly with dotenv in Node/Express."
- "Explain common reasons why a TypeScript-based Express server might fail silently on start."
- "How do I configure `tsx` to watch and compile my server code during development?"
- "What default environment variables does an Express server need for smooth boot-up?"
- "How to check if my Node.js server successfully connected to the port and services?"

### 5) Rollback Plan
If new code changes cause issues, revert to the last known working commit or comment out the new logging and dotenv code to restore previous behavior immediately.
