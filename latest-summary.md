# Surgical Report

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
1. **No server start confirmation** — Logs show boot message, but no confirmation that the server is listening; likely the server did not fully start.
2. **No error stacktrace or detailed error** — Only single error count with no details; possibly missing error handling or logging configuration.
3. **Potential environment variable setup issue** — Only NODE_ENV and PORT present; possibly missing other required env vars for full operation.
4. **No “listening on port” log line** — Possibly the server code lacks code to log once listening or server failed before listening.
5. **Using `tsx` with no compiled output logs** — Could indicate tsx is misconfigured or failing silently on TypeScript server/index.ts.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add explicit server listen confirmation log:

In `server/index.ts`, after app.listen line (example line 40):
```ts
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`); // Add this line
});
```

- Add global error handler middleware for Express (if missing) near server file start (around line 20):
```ts
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});
```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- No database connection strings visible — likely missing e.g. `DATABASE_URL`.
- Potentially missing API keys or SECRET keys (e.g. `JWT_SECRET`) needed for auth.
- Confirm if `.env` or equivalent file exists and is loaded before run.

## 4) Plain-English AI Prompts for Replit
1. "Explain common reasons why an Express server logs 'booting server' but does not show 'listening on port' confirmation."
2. "Show how to add a global error handler middleware in Express with TypeScript."
3. "How to safely load environment variables in a Node.js Express app using dotenv with TypeScript."
4. "What minimal logs should a Node.js Express server output to confirm it started successfully?"
5. "How to debug tsx not showing errors or output when running a TypeScript Express server."
6. "List common required environment variables for a REST Express app with authentication and database."

## 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to last known good commit where the server logged successful listening with detailed errors and verify all required environment variables and secrets are loaded. Deploy this stable version before attempting incremental fixes.
