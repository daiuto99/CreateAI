# Diagnostic Report

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No explicit error or failures shown aside from a single `[ERROR ×1]` line with no further details; likely a harmless startup message or minor log formatting issue.
- No health check failures; the `/healthz` endpoint is active and registered.
- Routes appear registered correctly, but no confirmation these endpoints respond successfully under load.
- Possible hidden or missing logs due to log level filtering or capture setup; the error context is missing.
- No evidence of port conflicts, but no check for binding errors on port 5000 shown.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Unknown file: Add explicit error detail logging on startup to capture and clarify the `[ERROR ×1]` entry, e.g.:

```js
// Example (Node.js + Express) in server.js or index.js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Express Error:', err);
  next(err);
});
```

- If no error handler present, add above middleware near line 50 (approx.).

- Add a startup log line to confirm no port binding errors, e.g.:

```js
server.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server started on port 5000'));
server.on('error', (err) => console.error('Server failed to start:', err));
```

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- No config/env variables referenced or missing in logs; check that `PORT=5000` or equivalent is set.
- Verify environment variables for API keys or database connection strings if endpoints depend on them, e.g., calendar API keys for `/api/calendar/events`.

## 4) Plain-English AI Prompts to Paste into Replit’s AI
- "Help me add detailed error logging middleware to my Express server."
- "How do I verify that Express server routes are responding correctly?"
- "What environment variables are required for an Express app serving calendar events?"
- "How to log server startup errors and confirm port binding in Node.js?"
- "Explain how to test the health endpoint `/healthz` programmatically."
- "Suggest minimal code changes to improve Express error visibility during launch."

## 5) Rollback Plan
If further deployment introduces errors, revert to the previous commit or image before adding new logging enhancements and verify previous stable port bindings, route registrations, and environment variable setups.
