# Surgical Report on Express Server Logs

### 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
- No explicit errors or warnings, only info logs and one line labeled "[ERROR]" but with no message; likely mis-labeled or insufficient logging.
- No sign of server startup errors; port 5000 is in use and routes registered properly.
- Missing explicit logs about failures or crash causes; possibly insufficient logging configuration.
- Lack of environment variable or configuration logs may imply missing env vars or secrets.
- No authentication/security middleware indicated for admin routes (e.g., `/admin/latest-log-summary`), potential security risk.

### 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add proper error handling middleware and detailed logging in the Express server (unknown file, likely `server.js` or `app.js`):
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
});
```
- Add security middleware (e.g., authentication) for sensitive routes:
```js
app.use('/admin', adminAuthMiddleware);
```
- Ensure logs include full error stack traces for better diagnostics.

### 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- Possibly missing `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 5000 used, but not explicit).
- No authentication secrets/config detected (e.g., JWT secret or API keys).
- No database or external API config shown, verify if required.

### 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
1. "How do I add centralized error handling middleware in Express.js?"
2. "What is the minimal way to add authentication middleware to protect admin routes in Express?"
3. "How to improve Express route logging to include error stack traces?"
4. "What environment variables are commonly required for an Express server?"
5. "How can I securely manage secrets and API keys for a Node.js app?"
6. "Explain a basic rollback strategy for a Node.js Express app deployment."

### 5) Rollback Plan (1–2 sentences)
Revert to the last known stable commit or deployment where the server successfully started with working routes and no errors, then incrementally add new changes with improved logging and security to quickly isolate issues.
