# Surgical Report: Express Server Startup Logs

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems and Likely Root Causes
- **No explicit error seen in logs**; only startup info lines provided.
- Potential silent failure if server stops after boot message (no "listening" confirmation).
- Missing environment variables or config could cause silent startup issues.
- Lack of log detail indicates insufficient logging during startup.
- Possible TypeScript runtime issues if `tsx` is not installed or configured.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- Add explicit logging in `server/index.ts` at the end of server setup to confirm listen:
  
  In `server/index.ts`, add around line ~30 (where server starts):
  ```ts
  app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${process.env.PORT || 5000}`);
  });
  ```
- Verify `tsx` is installed as a dev dependency:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev tsx
  ```
- Add more verbose error handling/logging in `server/index.ts` to catch startup issues.

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- `PORT` is set but confirm `NODE_ENV` dependent vars, e.g. DB_CONNECTION, API_KEYS.
- Confirm `.env` or equivalent config file is loaded (using `dotenv` or similar).
- Missing database connection string or secret keys might cause silent failure.

## 4) Replit AI Plain-English Prompts
- "Explain how to add startup confirmation logs in an Express.js TypeScript server."
- "How to ensure environment variables are correctly loaded in a Node.js app?"
- "List common silent failure causes when booting a Node.js Express server with TypeScript."
- "How to check if tsx is properly installed and used in a Node.js project?"
- "Provide examples of robust error handling in Express server startup scripts."
- "Suggest steps to debug why an Express server logs boot but doesn't respond."

## 5) Rollback Plan
If debugging fails, revert to last successful commit/tag with a confirmed working server. Alternatively, comment out recent changes in `server/index.ts` and retry startup to isolate cause.
