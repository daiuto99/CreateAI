# Surgical Report Based on Logs

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes

1. **Outdated Browserslist Data**  
   - Browserslist's caniuse-lite database is 11 months old. This can cause outdated browser compatibility in frontend builds.
2. **Repeated 304 (Not Modified) Responses**  
   - Multiple GET requests to `/api/otter/transcripts`, `/api/integrations`, `/api/airtable/contacts`, and `/api/meetings` return 304 with empty or cached responses, indicating possible caching issues or no new data.
3. **Unclear Firebase Bridge Auth Usage**  
   - Frequent POST requests to `/api/auth/firebase-bridge` succeed (200) very quickly (~4-11ms), possibly too fast to involve meaningful auth logic. May indicate skipped or superficial validation.
4. **Calendar Data Filtering Consistency**  
   - The log line "calendar: fetched 80 raw, returned 33 after window" repeats often, suggesting consistent filtering. If expected data volume is different, window/filter logic could be off.
5. **Performance – Some API calls (meetings GET) take ~300-400ms**  
   - `/api/meetings` GET requests have relatively long response times, indicating potential inefficiencies.

## 2) Exact Minimal Fixes

- **Fix outdated Browserslist DB**  
  - Run in project root:
    ```bash
    npx update-browserslist-db@latest
    ```
  - No code change, just environment update.

- **Improve caching or data freshness on GET APIs**  
  - File: likely `routes/otter.js`, `routes/integrations.js`, `routes/airtable.js`, or Express middleware handling cache headers.  
  - Minimal example fix (in Express route handlers):
    ```js
    // Add cache control headers to force fresh data or proper caching:
    res.set('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate');
    ```
- **Verify Firebase Bridge Auth logic**  
  - File: unknown; likely `routes/auth/firebase-bridge.js` or similar.  
  - Add detailed validation and logging inside POST `/api/auth/firebase-bridge` handler to ensure correct auth flow.  
  - Minimal example:
    ```js
    console.log('Firebase auth payload:', req.body);
    // Add real token verification here
    ```
- **Review calendar window filtering logic**  
  - File: unknown; search for `calendar: fetched` log in codebase.  
  - Validate that window filter returns expected meeting count; add unit tests or manual checks.
- **Profile and optimize `/api/meetings` GET**  
  - File: unknown; likely in `routes/meetings.js`.  
  - Consider DB query indexing or result pagination.

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config

- No direct evidence from logs, but ensure presence of:  
  - `FIREBASE_API_KEY` or equivalent Firebase credentials.  
  - Environment config for Browserslist DB update frequency (could be supplied via CI scripts).  
  - Cache-related config (e.g., Redis or in-memory store) if used for optimizations.

## 4) Suggested Replit AI Prompts to Improve or Debug

1. "Explain why Browserslist caniuse-lite data needs regular updating and how to automate it in Node projects."
2. "How do HTTP 304 Not Modified responses work and when should we disable caching in Express APIs?"
3. "Provide a secure example of Firebase token verification middleware in Express.js."
4. "Analyze how to optimize slow GET API calls in Node.js Express with MongoDB or SQL queries."
5. "How to add cache-control headers in Express.js routes for API responses?"
6. "Explain best practices for filtering calendar events by time window in JavaScript."

## 5) Rollback Plan

If new changes cause issues, revert by restoring the previous commit in version control, then restart the server. Alternatively, rollback the Browserslist DB update by clearing `node_modules/.cache` or lockfile updates.
