# Diagnostic Report: calendar module error

### 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- **Problem:** `ical.parseICS is not a function`  
  **Root Cause:** The `ical` package changed its API or is incorrectly imported, and `parseICS` does not exist or is misreferenced.
- **Problem:** Outdated or incompatible `ical` package version causing missing functions.
- **Problem:** Incorrect use or naming of the function from the `ical` library (e.g., should use `parseICS` from another import or use a different method).
- **Problem:** Missing or improperly imported module leading to undefined functions.

### 2) Minimal Fixes
- Check import line for `ical`; it should likely be:  
  ```js
  import ical from 'ical'; // or 
  const ical = require('ical');
  ```
- Correct function usage based on `ical` library docs; for example, replace `ical.parseICS` with `ical.parseICS()` or correct method like:
  ```js
  const data = ical.parseICS(icsString); 
  ```
  might instead need to be:
  ```js
  const data = ical.parseICS(icsString);
  ```
  or if unavailable, use the method `ical.parseICS` renamed or replaced.

- If no `parseICS` exists, replace with `ical.parseICS` to `ical.parseICS` or use this common usage pattern:
  ```js
  const data = ical.parseICS(icsString); // confirm exact method name with the package docs
  ```
- File: **Unknown (likely calendar module file where the error appears)**  
- Fix import and function call lines to the up-to-date/valid API.

### 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Configs
- None indicated from logs related to this issue.
