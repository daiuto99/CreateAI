## Surgical Report

### 1) Top problems & likely root causes
- **HTTP 401 Unauthorized on POST /api/integrations/test**
  - Root cause: Missing or invalid authentication when testing integration credentials (likely missing token or headers).
- **Browserslist data 12 months old**
  - Root cause: Outdated caniuse-lite database causing potential frontend compatibility issues.
- **No visible errors on GET /api/integrations and POST /api/integrations, but test endpoint fails**
  - Root cause: Integration credentials are saved but not properly validated/tested with external service.
- **Sensitive credentials logged in plaintext**
  - Root cause: Credentials such as applicationPassword are printed openly in logs — security risk.
- **No explicit config or env vars shown for API auth**
  - Root cause: Possibly missing or misconfigured API keys/tokens for third-party integration testing.

### 2) Exact minimal fixes
- **Fix auth error in `/api/integrations/test` handler to include correct auth headers**  
  _File unknown, suggested code snippet to add to test request logic:_

  ```js
  // Example minimal fix inside API handler making external request:
  fetch(integrationUrl, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Basic ${btoa(`${username}:${applicationPassword}`)}`, // or bearer token if used
      //... other headers
    }
  })
  ```

- **Update Browserslist database**  
  Run in project root (no code change):  
  ```
  npx update-browserslist-db@latest
  ```

- **Sanitize logs to avoid sensitive data leakage**  
  Replace:

  ```js
  console.log('[integrations] Received request body:', req.body);
  ```
  with
  ```js
  const safeBody = {...req.body, credentials: 'REDACTED'};
  console.log('[integrations] Received request body:', safeBody);
  ```

- **Add env var validation in startup script to confirm third-party API credentials present** (file unknown, pseudocode):

  ```js
  if (!process.env.WORDPRESS_USERNAME || !process.env.WORDPRESS_APP_PASSWORD) {
    console.error('Missing Wordpress credentials in environment variables');
    process.exit(1);
  }
  ```

### 3) Missing env vars / configs
- WORDPRESS_USERNAME
- WORDPRESS_APP_PASSWORD (or applicationPassword, appropriately secured)
- Possibly API tokens/keys required to authorize /api/integrations/test requests
- No mention of token for external API calls to Wordpress or other providers

### 4) Plain-English prompts for Replit’s AI
1. "Why am I getting HTTP 401 unauthorized when testing a Wordpress integration API with saved credentials?"
2. "Show me code to add HTTP Basic Authentication headers for integration testing in Express.js."
3. "How to securely log request bodies in Node.js without leaking sensitive passwords?"
4. "Explain how to update Browserslist data and why it matters in frontend projects."
5. "What environment variables are needed for authenticating Wordpress REST API integrations?"
6. "Help me write a startup check to validate required environment variables in a Node.js app."

### 5) Rollback plan
Revert to the last known good commit before changes to `/api/integrations/test` and logging code. Deploy quickly to restore functionality and prevent credentials leakage.
