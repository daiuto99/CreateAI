# Diagnostic Report: Server Boot Logs

## 1) Top Problems & Likely Root Causes
- No explicit errors other than a single `[ERROR ×1]` with no accompanying message, suggesting missing or misconfigured logging of errors.
- Possible silent failure or premature exit after server boot initiation.
- Environment variables present (`NODE_ENV`, `PORT`), but no explicit confirmation server started successfully, indicating incomplete startup or misconfigured scripts.
- No detailed error output to diagnose actual failure cause.
- Potential TypeScript execution issues with `tsx` if environment or dependencies are incomplete.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Unknown file:** Enhance error logging for visibility.
  ```ts
  // In server/index.ts (around application initialization)
  process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
    console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
  });
  process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason) => {
    console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason);
  });
  ```
- Confirm server start success with logs:
  ```ts
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
  ```
- Verify `tsx` is installed and up to date: `npm install tsx --save-dev`.

## 3) Missing Env Vars/Secrets/Config
- PORT=5000 is set but verify if other required configs like database URLs, API keys, or TLS certs are missing.
- Confirm `.env` file or equivalent config includes anything used by server/index.ts.
- No indication from logs, but typical missed vars might include:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `JWT_SECRET`
  - `API_KEY`

## 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
- "Explain why a Node.js Express server shows no startup errors but also does not confirm running in logs."
- "How to improve error reporting and visibility when running TypeScript server with tsx?"
- "What minimal environment variables must be set to start an Express server in development?"
- "How do I handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections in a Node.js app?"
- "Guide me to verify and fix a Node.js development script that runs: NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts"
- "How to confirm a server is fully started and listening on a port in Express?"

## 5) Rollback Plan
Revert to the last known working commit or version where server startup logs included successful startup messages and no silent failures, then incrementally add new changes ensuring proper error logging and environment configuration.
