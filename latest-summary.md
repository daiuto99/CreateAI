# Surgical Report

## 1) Top 3–5 Problems with Likely Root Causes
1. **POST /api/integrations returns 404**  
   - Root Cause: The POST route for `/api/integrations` is not implemented or incorrectly registered in Express.
2. **GET /api/meetings/dismissed returns 401 Unauthorized**  
   - Root Cause: Missing or invalid user authentication credentials (e.g., JWT token, session).
3. **GET /api/otter/transcripts and /api/airtable/contacts return empty arrays**  
   - Root Cause: These endpoints succeed but return no data, possibly due to empty data sources or misconfigured queries/filters.
4. **GET /api/integrations returns 304 Not Modified with empty array**  
   - Root Cause: Response cache might be outdated, or no new data is available.
5. **Calendar fetch returns fewer records after filtering**  
   - Root Cause: Calendar filtering logic is working as designed, but it may need validation if less data than expected.

## 2) Exact, Minimal Fixes
- **Fix POST /api/integrations route not found:**  
  *File:* `routes/integrations.js` (or wherever API routes are registered).  
  *Action:* Add a POST handler:  
  ```js
  router.post('/integrations', (req, res) => {
    // Minimal stub implementation
    res.status(200).json({ ok: true, message: "Integration created" });
  });
  ```
- **Fix 401 on GET /api/meetings/dismissed — Authentication Middleware:**  
  *File:* Authentication middleware file or route file for `/meetings/dismissed`.  
  *Action:* Ensure authentication token is required and correctly verified; fix missing token forwarding in client requests.
- **Empty data responses:**  
  *File:* Data query files for `/otter/transcripts` and `/airtable/contacts`.  
  *Action:* Verify database/API credentials and queries return expected data.
- **Caching header configuration for /api/integrations:**  
  *File:* Route handler for `/api/integrations`.  
  *Action:* Check if cache-control headers or ETag logic needs adjustments to correctly reflect data changes.

## 3) Missing Env Vars / Secrets / Config
- Authentication secrets or tokens (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, API keys for Otter and Airtable) may be missing or incorrect.
- Possibly missing database connection strings or API credentials for integrations.
- No explicit error log about missing env vars, but 401 and empty data suggest authentication/config issues.

## 4) Plain-English Prompts for Replit AI
1. "How can I implement a POST route in Express that handles `/api/integrations` and returns a JSON success message?"
2. "Explain why an Express GET route might return 401 Unauthorized and how to fix authentication issues."
3. "Help me debug why my API endpoints return empty arrays even though I expect data from Airtable and Otter."
4. "How do I configure cache headers correctly in Express to avoid 304 Not Modified responses with stale data?"
5. "What environment variables are typically required to authenticate with JWT and third-party APIs like Airtable and Otter?"
6. "Show me a minimal Express middleware example that verifies JWT tokens in an API route."

## 5) Rollback Plan
If these fixes cause issues, rollback by restoring the previous stable commit where all routes were working, and verify with tests that responses and authentication flow are correct before reapplying changes.
